<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great website that provide the information regarding the location of ISS and if looked closely, it can be monitored at any given time. However, it requires a lot of manual research into it which leads to this project. This project aims to make the job easier for people to track ISS locations at a given time all with simple few clicks! Not only does it gives coordinates of the positions, this project also aims to provide raw data for references and plotting the actual locations on a map! How wonderful is that?! Reasons why you should use this project:

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. This project helps make your life easier!
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like researching for the ISS details one by one.
* You should work smart! :smile:

Of course, this project is not perfectly well-made, but gets the jobs done! :wink:
